                                  ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING  ⚠️
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Checksum verification is DISABLED. The downloaded binary will NOT be verified
against the expected SHA-256 hash from the release.

This means you CANNOT detect if the binary has been:
  • Corrupted during download
  • Tampered with by a malicious actor
  • Modified from what the project released

Risks of installing without checksum verification:
  → You may install a compromised binary
  → A malicious actor could inject arbitrary code
  → Your system and data could be at risk

The bead-rs project strongly recommends AGAINST this option. Only use it if:
  • You are in a controlled environment with alternative verification
  • You fully understand and accept the security risks
  • This is a temporary workaround for network/infrastructure issues

For normal installations, press Ctrl+C to abort and fix the checksum issue.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Press Enter to continue with checksum verification DISABLED, or Ctrl+C to abort...

    # Prompt only when stdin is a terminal. The documented pipe invocation
    # (curl ... | bash -s -- --skip-checksum) has no stdin left to read:
    # `read -r` returns 1 at EOF, which under `set -e` aborted the install
    # right after this warning instead of proceeding with the opt-out.

Usage: install.sh [OPTIONS]

Installs the bead binary to ~/.local/bin/bead (or \$BEAD_INSTALL_PATH).

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help              Show this help message
    --skip-checksum         Skip checksum verification (NOT RECOMMENDED - see SECURITY below)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    BEAD_INSTALL_PATH      Installation path (default: ~/.local/bin/bead)
    BEAD_SKIP_CHECKSUM     Set to '1' or 'true' to skip checksum verification (NOT RECOMMENDED)

SECURITY NOTE:
    This installer verifies SHA-256 checksums to ensure the downloaded binary has not been
    corrupted or tampered with. Checksum verification is enabled by default for your safety.

    ⚠️  SKIPPING CHECKSUM VERIFICATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED:
    The --skip-checksum flag and BEAD_SKIP_CHECKSUM environment variable allow you to bypass
    verification, but this exposes you to significant security risks:

    • A corrupted binary could crash or behave unpredictably
    • A tampered binary could execute arbitrary malicious code
    • You cannot verify the binary matches what the project released

    These options should ONLY be used as a temporary workaround when:
    • Checksums.txt is temporarily unavailable due to network/infrastructure issues
    • You have alternative verification methods in place
    • You fully understand and accept the security risks

    IMPORTANT: Even with --skip-checksum, actual checksum MISMATCHES will still cause
    installation to abort. This flag only applies when checksums are unavailable, not when
    they indicate a mismatch.

Examples:
    # Normal installation (recommended)
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/jedarden/bead-rs/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

    # Skip checksum verification (NOT recommended, use with caution)
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/jedarden/bead-rs/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-checksum

    # Skip via environment variable (NOT recommended, use with caution)
    BEAD_SKIP_CHECKSUM=1 curl -fsSL https://github.com/jedarden/bead-rs/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
